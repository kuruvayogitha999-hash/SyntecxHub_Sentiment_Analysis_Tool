# 🎯 Sentiment Analysis Tool (IMDB Dataset)
A complete end-to-end Sentiment Analysis project implemented in **Google Colab**, using  
**TF-IDF Vectorization + Logistic Regression** for binary classification (Positive / Negative).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project trains a machine learning model to classify movie reviews from the **IMDB dataset**.  
The entire workflow is performed in **Google Colab**, and all artifacts (model, vectorizer, plots)  
are stored in **Google Drive**.
